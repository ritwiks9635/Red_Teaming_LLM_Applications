# Red_Teaming_LLM_Applications
**Red teaming** is a way of interactively testing AI models to protect against harmful behavior, including leaks of sensitive data and generated content that's toxic, biased, or factually inaccurate. Red teaming predates modern generative AI by many decades.

Red teaming is a focused, goal-oriented security testing method that is designed to achieve specific objectives. If the objective of a red team is to access a sensitive server or a business-critical application, its success will be measured by how well it can accomplish this objective.

**What is red teaming used for?**

Red teaming occurs when ethical hackers are authorized by your organization to emulate real attackers' tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) against your own systems. It is a security risk assessment service that your organization can use to proactively identify and remediate IT security gaps and weaknesses.

**What is an example of red teaming?**

The Red Team is always the attacking side. With an arsenal of 'tactics, techniques and procedures' (TTPs) that are also used by malicious hackers. Examples are (spear) phishing, ransomware, (identity) spoofing, session hijacking and injection attacks.
